    <p> <u> Top 10 Genres in the Indian Music Industry </u>     
           The uniqueness of every music genre in India brings us together. <br> 
        We all know the unique style of Indian Music, which has billions of fans worldwide, 
         both inside and outside India. But did you know that the influence of Indian Music on
         Western Music is as old as the Beatles? Today's article briefly introduces the types of
          Indian Music that vary by era, genre, and region.So let's dive in without any 
          further effort/p>
         <div class="row">
            <div class="Musics-col">
                <h3> <u> Carnatic Music </u> </h3>
                <p>Carnatic Music began in South India during the Vijayanagara Empire and
                     can be traced back to the 14th century. Due to its southern origin, 
                     the Music is very close but far less influenced by Persia and Asia than
                      Hindu music and has more Hindu origin. Carnatic Music is also one of 
                      the main characters in film music of the last century.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Musics-col">
                <h3><u> Hindustani Music  </u></h3>
                <p>Hindustani Music is considered Northern Music. This is because Music began
                     in the Vedic period, and musicians usually sang ancient religious hymns. 
                     Under the influence of Persia, it belonged to Carnatic Music until it 
                     appeared as another type in the 14th century. As a result, Hindustani
                      music has a strong presence in Bollywood, which is familiar to the western world. In the last decade, traces of Hindustani music can be seen in A. R. Rahman's music.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Musics-col">
                <h3> <u> Light Classical Music </u> </h3>
                <p>The Indian Classical Music category also has a variety of very similar 
                    but mild styles. These are known as "semi-classical" Indian or 
                    "light-classical" Music such as Chaiti, Natya Sangeet, Bhajan, Qawwali, 
                    Thumri, Kajari, Tappa, Dadra, Ghazal.</p>

 <h1>What Our Music Says</h1>
    <p>There is no one answer to this question, as music can say different things about different people. 
        However, there are some general things that music can reveal about a person's personality. For example, 
        someone who listens to a lot of upbeat, happy music may be seen as being a generally positive and upbeat
         person.</p>
