    <p>Top 10 Genres in the Indian Music Industry
        The uniqueness of every music genre in India brings us together. 
        We all know the unique style of Indian Music, which has billions of fans worldwide,
         both inside and outside India. But did you know that the influence of Indian Music on 
         Western Music is as old as the Beatles? Today's article briefly introduces the types of
          Indian Music that vary by era, genre, and region.So let's dive in without any 
          further effort/p>

                <h3>Carnatic Music course</h3>
                <p>Carnatic Music began in South India during the Vijayanagara Empire and
                     can be traced back to the 14th century. Due to its southern origin, 
                     the Music is very close but far less influenced by Persia and Asia than
                      Hindu music and has more Hindu origin. Carnatic Music is also one of 
                      the main characters in film music of the last century.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="Musics-col">
                <h3>Hindustani Music course</h3>
                <p>Hindustani Music is considered Northern Music. This is because Music began
                     in the Vedic period, and musicians usually sang ancient religious hymns. 
                     Under the influence of Persia, it belonged to Carnatic Music until it 
                     appeared as another type in the 14th century. As a result, Hindustani
                      music has a strong presence in Bollywood, which is familiar to the western world. In the last decade, traces of Hindustani music can be seen in A. R. Rahman's music.</p>

                <h3> Light Classical Music course</h3>
                <p>The Indian Classical Music category also has a variety of very similar 
                    but mild styles. These are known as "semi-classical" Indian or 
                    "light-classical" Music such as Chaiti, Natya Sangeet, Bhajan, Qawwali, 
                    Thumri, Kajari, Tappa, Dadra, Ghazal.</p>

    <p> Although definitions of music vary wildly throughout the world, 
        every known culture partakes in it, and music is thus considered a cultural 
         The origins <br>of music remain highly contentious; commentators often relate it to
          the origin of language, with much disagreement surrounding whether music arose before, <br> after or simultaneously with language. Many theories have been proposed by scholars from a wide range of disciplines, though none have achieved wide approval.<br> Most cultures have their own mythical origins concerning the invention of music, generally rooted in their respective mythological, religious or philosophical beliefs.</p>
